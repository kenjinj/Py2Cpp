This is the Lexical Analyzer for Project 1
CS 460 - Spring 2016.

What works: All valid tokens should be identified correctly, with correct output to files.

What doesn't work: Nothing as far as I know, although I'm not sure if '-1' should be identified 
as only an INTLIT_T "-1" or as MINUS_T "-" and INTLIT_T "1". I currently have the latter implemented.
